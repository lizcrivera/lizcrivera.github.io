	<p> He takes you to his new home, a ginormous dark and mysterious shipwreck at the bottom of the ocean. He assures you it's safe so you swim into the hull of the ship with him. He has so many treasures in his rooms. Both of you look around at all the trinkets he's collecting throughout his beautiful long meaningful octopus life. What a great memory. You say goodbye to your new octopus friend since its getting late. As you turn to leave he hugs you with all of his octopus tentacles and says "Hope you had a fun ocean adventure!"<p>

	<p>He takes you to his home, the coral reef! You are amazed by all the colors surrounding you, and you can see that the turtle is pretty popular in his coral reef, because all the fish surround you both in excitement. He introduces you to all his fish friends. It turns out he is the mayor of his reef. You notice that it's starting to get late so after Mayor Turtle gives you a tour of his reef, you say goodbye to him and all the fish friends you made. As you leave the fish call out to you "Come back soon so that we can join you for another ocean adventure!"</p>
